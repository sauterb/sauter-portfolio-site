I'm currently a senior at Oregon State University. My professional interests include renewable energy, algorithms, and pretty much anything where hardware intersects software. I currently am serving as the head TA for the Fundamentals of Electricity Courses and working as a research assistant in the OSU Energy Systems Lab. I'm currently looking for both full-time and internship opportunities.

Outside of engineering, I can be found running, biking or hiking through nature with friends and family. Check out my Strava stats below.
