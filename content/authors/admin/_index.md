I'm currently a second-year Ph.D. student working at the Colorado Power Electronics Center at the University of Colorado Boulder. My professional interests include renewable energy, machine learning, and power electronics. At the moment, I'm a graduate research assistant. Past employment has included the Oregon State Energy Systems Lab in Corvallis OR, Tektronix in Beaverton OR, and Imperix in Sion Switzerland.
