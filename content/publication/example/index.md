abstract: Solar-powered energy efficient buildings could tie
HVAC systems with solar energy and the grid to function together. Such HVAC systems require the grid, batteries, or other
energy storage to supply or consume the excess power. This
paper presents four different control architectures for solarpowered HVAC systems, focusing on their DC-DC converters.
The analysis finds that a higher transformer turns ratio, as
within the converter, is required on architectures with a fixed
DC bus as opposed to those with a varying DC bus. On the other
hand, the varying DC bus architectures require a wider duty
ratio range, higher input inductance and output capacitance, a
finding compounded due to larger low-power voltage ripples.
The results are validated via hardware experimental testing
from a 500 W solar simulator (power supply), a front-end
current-fed full-bridge DC-DC converter, and a variable load
mimicking the HVAC. A table then summarizes the features,
advantages, and disadvantages of each architecture.
